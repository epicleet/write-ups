At some point Sophia has realized that a few messages were being intercepted and it has decided to send encrypted messages at random and the encryption parameters were sent as a separate message to different people on the same team, so that the chances of both messages being intercepted were much smaller, almost negligible. We have been able to intercept the main message with great effort and we believe that, like Sophia code, there is a flaw in its encryption method. Can you help us find the information we are looking for? Ah... Rebellious Fingers has done a great job of stealing the encryption method binary and sending it to 2019 along with the broadcast!
